background hpc run

nohup python3 volget9.py > volget9.out 2>\&1 \&



1️⃣ Use nohup to run in background

\# Make sure you are in your working folder

cd ~/stonx1



\# Run volget6.py in the background, redirect output to a log file

nohup python3 volget6.py > volget6.out 2>\&1 \&





> volget6.out captures stdout (prints from your script).



2>\&1 captures stderr (errors) in the same file.



\& runs it in the background so you can close your terminal.



nohup ensures the process keeps running even if you log out.



2️⃣ Monitor progress

\# Live tailing the log file your script writes

**tail -f ~/stonx1/vol\_calc9.log**





or, to watch the nohup output:



**tail -f ~/stonx1/volget9.out**





Ctrl+C will stop the tailing but not the script itself.



3️⃣ Check running background jobs

jobs           # lists jobs in current terminal

ps -u $USER    # shows all processes you own



4️⃣ Stop the script if needed

\# Find the process ID (PID)

ps -u $USER | grep volget6.py



\# Kill the process

kill <PID>





✅ This setup lets you close your laptop, the script keeps running, and you can check progress periodically via tail -f.
